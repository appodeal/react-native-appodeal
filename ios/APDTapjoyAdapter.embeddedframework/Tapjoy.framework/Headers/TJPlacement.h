/**
  The Tapjoy placement-Based Framework allows one to identify key placements within their application during development,
  and then reconfigure them on the dashboard as desired to help maximize monetization and engagement, without the need to update or resubmit the application.
  
  Use the TJPlacement class to define placement points in your application where ads and other content can be served.
  placements could include launching the application, completing an achievement, finishing a level, or any other moment conducive to communicating with your users.
 
  During your application development process, the key steps are to:
 
  1. Create and configure each placement as a TJPlacement
 
        TJPlacement *placement = [TJPlacement placementWithName: @"level_complete" delegate: self];
 
  2. Request content
 
        [placement requestContent];
 
  3. Present any content that is returned by the placement callbacks defined in TJPlacementDelegate
