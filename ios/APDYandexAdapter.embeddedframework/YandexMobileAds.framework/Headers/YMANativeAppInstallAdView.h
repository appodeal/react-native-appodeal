/**
 * YMANativeAppInstallAdView represents view for app install ad type. 
 * It contains views for all of app install ad assets.
 * Views for all of the required assets should be set,
 * although ad may not contain age restrictions, icon, warning or call to action.
 * If any of the required views is not provided for ad which contains corresponding assets, binding fails.
 * Optional views may be provided to increase CTR.
 *
 * @discussion Typically, any ad has title, body and sponsored assets.
 * Ad may have age, warning, icon and call to action. In case if ad has these assets, app has to display them.
 * Other assets are optional.
 *
 * YMANativeAppInstallAd provided by loader should be used to set ad assets into view.
